# User identification 

User identification - important tool for detecting userâ€™s behavior in the global net. 
This tool might prevent undesirable transactions or notice unusual user actions in Bank systems, e-mails, etc.
In this project I'm detecting strange behavior according to the user's internet surfing sessions.
What was done:

* Data preparation to sparse matrix format.
* Some statistics analysis to be sure that the data really contains unusual behavior.
* Visual analysis: there were selected some people with different activities.
* Based on previous case some new features were introduced.


To be continued.
